# HeartFailureClassification
In the second year of university, I had an assignment for the module 'Intelligent Systems 1' called 'Open Ended Project'. This project involved finding a dataset for a classification/ regression problem, training & testing pre-existing models on the dataset, evaluating performance, and fine-tuning the system to (potentially) increase the models' performances. The sole functionality of my system of algorithms/models is to accurately predict whether a person has heart disease or not. This is based on various types of clinical data collected from hospitals. The models are measured using the evaluation metrics 'accuracy' and 'precision', which correlate to an extent, however are different ways of measuring overall performance. I analysed the results from various tests of performance, and attempted to fine-tune the systen. Finally, I had to write a detailed report including the details of the algorithm, dataset, the real-world problem that it solves, and my conclusions based on the performance.
